**REFLECTION:**
What I am finding is that there seems to be multiple ways you can achieve the same outcome. However, it's only when you're a bit further down the rabbit hole that you'll realise if you've made the most efficient choice or not.

I am relying heavily on the internet (websites, forums and ChatGPT) for help. I'm trying to ask the questions to only the bits I'm stuck with and asking ChatGPT to simplify things for me which is helping as I'm struggling with the language/syntax.

I have been able to create a website and put five images together in a line, with a header and a pink background.

I've started writing the event handler click function but cannot get it to work, and at this stage, I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.

I am no way near writing CSS code to make it responsive and haven't got to looking at accessibility such as aria labels other than the alt text.

I am concerned overall that this is showing me my problem solving skills may be very good - albeit slow - as it's taken me 3 hours with lots of googling to get it to work, but I'm concerned as I don't think I'd be able to explain it back to you clearly if you asked me to translate how it's working, line by line!

My weaknesses are definitely still CSS and event functions - how do I get the images clickable and then put them in the large container?
My strengths are that some of the tasks are becoming a bit second nature - using the terminal, setting up HTML templates, linking to CSS and JS.
